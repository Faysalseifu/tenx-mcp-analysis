# GitHub Copilot Custom Instructions

## Project Overview
This repository is for Tenx MCP analysis setup and documentation. Focus on clean, maintainable, efficient code.

## Tech Stack & Conventions
- Language: Markdown and JSON configuration files.
- Naming: Use clear, consistent identifiers and filenames.
- Style: Keep configuration minimal and explicit.
- Error handling: Prefer explicit instructions and avoid ambiguous steps.
- Comments: Only when necessary for clarity.

## Workflow & Best Practices
- Always plan complex changes first: outline steps, risks, and verification before writing code.
- Verify everything: After changes, run tests/lint/build when available. If none, state that.
- Boundaries:
	- Always: Keep edits small and focused.
	- Ask first: Before deleting code or making major refactors.
	- Never: Add secrets, modify unrelated files, or skip verification.
- If a mistake repeats: suggest updating these instructions to prevent it.
